# canvas

My scratchbuilt game framework, some basic physics, and some interesting demos.

* Useful Canvas and Game abstractions
* Multi-channel audio support
* Mouse and Keyboard support
* Physics - constraints, collision detection, spatial partitioning 

## Demos
* Basic - Draws multiple color rectangles on the screen. Demonstrates mouse interaction. 
* Balls - Balls bouncing about in a constraining box. Demonstrates mouse interaction, double buffering, and Physics (constraints + deflection). 
* Asteroids - A playable version of the classic 1979 space shooter. Full featured demo of Physics (w/Spatial Partitioning), Keyboard, double buffering, and Audio.

## scripts
run the demo(s)
```
npm start
```

run the tests
```
npm test
```

generate test coverage report
```
npm run coverage
open coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```
